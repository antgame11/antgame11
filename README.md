<h1 align="center">Hello, I'm Andrew! (aka Ant)</h1>

<h3 align="center">
  I'm a 17 year old amateur developer and a licensed ham radio operator
</h3> <!-- If you're curious, I have the Technician license -->
<br>
<p align="center">
  I can develop both backend and frontend. I struggle with frontend but I'm still able to write something functional, lol.
  <br><br>
  I don't have professional experience and I'm still learning proper coding
  practices, but I'm motivated to improve and grow as a developer over time. :)
  <br><br>
  I'd say my knowledge is very broad, I know a lot about stuff related to development, security, electronics, Linux, but I'm not a professional in anything.
